Three years on from the Olympic Games in 2012, the City of London and Great Britain as a whole continue to enjoy the benefits from hosting the Games. The Games generated a huge interest in sport across the country and many initiatives have been put in place to capitalise on the enthusiasm and encourage people to get involved. Since 2011, Sport England has invested GBP 165 million in more than 2,400 community sports facilities while, in London, there have been 400,000 participants in grassroots sport and physical activities through the Mayor of London’s sports legacy programme.
