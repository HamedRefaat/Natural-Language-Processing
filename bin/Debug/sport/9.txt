Women's boxing pioneer Nicola Adams added a European Games gold medal to her Olympic and Commonwealth Games titles when she won the women's flyweight final in Baku, Azerbaijan. The 32-year-old immediately labelled herself "the comeback kid". It was all the sweeter for Adams who missed the chance to add a first World Amateur Championship title to her decorated career after an injury sidelined her last year. Almost three years after she became the first women's Olympic boxing champion, Adams won by majority decision against Poland's Sandra Drabik in the first boxing final to be staged at the inaugural European Games. Two judges scored the four-round fight 39-37 for Adams, with the third ruling a 38-38 draw.
