Tennis players have historically complained, often bitterly, about their sport's lack of an offseason. Their response lately has been the somewhat puzzling decision to ... play more tennis in the paltry few weeks that once passed for their fleeting winter break.Take the WTA. The tour theoretically goes dark when the folks in Singapore (or wherever the WTA Championships are decided) flick off the stadium lights after the final match. But did you notice Venus Williams was among the stars who won a tournament AFTER the conclusion of the nominal "year-end championships?"Furthermore, the WTA also staged a four-tournament series following the Singapore shootout, and it wasn't for struggling youngsters testing the pro waters, either.
