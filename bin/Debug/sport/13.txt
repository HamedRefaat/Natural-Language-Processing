UCLA will name the floor of the Men's Basketball practice facility Russell Westbrook Court after his significant financial contribution. The gift is the largest by a former basketball student-athlete in UCLA history. Russell isn’t merely a dominant force in the NBA, he’s a force to be reckoned with in the community as well, said Director of Athletics Dan Guerrero. “While his Why Not? Foundation’s mission is to inspire the lives of children and teach them to never give up, the fact of the matter is, having witnessed firsthand and from afar his growth over the years, Russell himself is an inspiration. We could not be more proud of his leadership both on and off the court since he left Westwood.
