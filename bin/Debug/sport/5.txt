Manchester United will face Danish side Midtjylland in the last 32 of the Europa League after failing to make the knockout stage of the Champions League.United were beaten 3-2 by Wolfsburg in the final set of group games last week and now face the side that put Southampton out of the competition during the qualifying stage.Tottenham's reward for winning their group is a tough trip to Italy to take on Serie A side Fiorentina, who knocked Mauricio Pochettino's side out 3-1 on aggregate at the same stage last season.
