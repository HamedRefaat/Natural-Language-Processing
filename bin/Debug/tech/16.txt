Microsoft extends olive branch after OneDrive cloud storage storm One month after shrinking OneDrive storage limits and completely axing "unlimited" cloud storage, Microsoft says it's sorry and is offering to give something back. But users will still need to opt-in, and the bonuses won't last forever. Microsoft has back-pedalled on cuts it made to OneDrive cloud storage limits last month, giving back some of the data allowances it was set to take away and apologising for putting the blame on users for excessive use.
