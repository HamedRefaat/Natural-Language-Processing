Strengthening its push into the Internet of Things, IBM is making a range of application programming interfaces (APIs) available through its Watson IoT unit and opening up new facilities for the group. The unit, formed earlier this year with a US$3 billion investment into IoT, will have its global headquarters in Munch, IBM announced Tuesday. IoT will soon be the largest source of data in the world but, IBM officials point out, almost 90 percent of that information is never acted on -- at least not yet. Many vendors are jumping on the IoT bandwagon and IBM faces a variety of competitors.
