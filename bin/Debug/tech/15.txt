HTC has shared the company's latest deal, which sees the RE Camera price slashed by 60% to just $79.60 (originally $199). As well as the camera, HTC is also offering 40% off all accessories.
Unfortunately, if you're looking to splash out on a handful of units, HTC is restricting customers to just 3 RE Cameras per account, as well as 10 accessories. It's also worth noting that today's offers end at 11:59 p.m. PT and are only available in the US.
