Outlook for iOS gets 3D Touch support With the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, Apple introduced a new feature dubbed as “3D Touch” which allows users to easily access an app’s quick actions, or use the Peek and Pop features (if available). Today, Microsoft added 3D Touch support for the official Outlook for iOS. With the latest update, users can now create new emails, events, and access their calendar just by force touching the app on their home screen.
