A new smartphone just hit the market that claims its battery can last 10 to 15 days without charging.The Oukitel K10000 is crammed with a 10,000mAh battery, which should hold almost four times the charge of a Samsung Galaxy S6, and  iPhone 6.A full charge takes about three and a half hours, according to Oukitel, a Chinese gadget maker.Smartphone software has gotten better at managing apps and programs to conserve battery life over the past few years, but not many manufacturers have upgraded battery capacity itself.
